## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).

### Local Setup

Clone the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pi-apps/crumbles.git
```

Setup a `virtualvenv` and use `pip` to install the project dependencies.

```sh
cd crumbles
python3 -m virualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable, create the SQLite database, and start the app. Now you can give the application a try at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!

```sh
export FLASK_APP=flaskeddit.py
flask cli create_db
flask run
```


## Deployment

crumbles can be hosted on [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). You have to register at pythonanywhere and upload the files.
Additionally you have to use the `__init__-pythonanywhere.py` file within the flaskeddit-folder.

Then make following changes to the wsgi configuration file in the web-tab:
```
# import flask app but need to call it "application" for WSGI to work
from flaskeddit import created_app as application  # noqa
```
